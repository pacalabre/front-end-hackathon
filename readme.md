#Weekend Frontend Hackathon

###Learn something new and build something cool in a weekend.

Your assignment for this weekend is to learn a new frontend library and build something **cool**. A big part of being a developer is being able to adapt and learn new technologies on your own. Below is a list of libraries that we think are interesting, but feel free to find something completely different (just nothing we've already learned).

##Requirements

* Fork and clone this repository
* Use an external javascript library to create a website of your choice
* Focus on frontend
    * Make something visually interesting
    * Make something you'd be proud to show to others
* commit and push to github frequently

Don't worry about a backend for this project. Your project will probably just be an HTML file, some CSS, and some JavaScript (no Rails or Node needed).

##Front end (Javascript) Libraries


I started off planning on using three.js, which I did play around with for a while and long enough to get an idea of how to use it. I plan on continuing to play around with three.js, but was unable to upload photos onto the geometric shapes which was crutial to what it was that I wanted to do, so I insead made some graphs of snowfall over that last 10 years at various ski resorts. I will use these as additions for my powstash project.
